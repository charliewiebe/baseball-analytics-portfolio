    "text": "I modeled pitch quality across pitch counts within individual starts to see whether the addition of the pitch clock made pitchers fade earlier. Comparing 2020–2022 vs 2023–2025, the fatigue curve is strikingly similar, including one curious blip: a consistent uptick in pitch quality right before ~pitch 65, followed by a steep drop.\n\n“Pitch quality” here means predicted offensive production given the pitch (velocity, movement, location, context), not what actually happened. That keeps defense, luck, batter quality, and times-through-the-order out of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filenames\nDATA_POST = \"statcast_2023_2025.csv\"\nDATA_PRE  = \"statcast_2020_2022.csv\"\n\n# Modeling knobs\nEV_THRESH       = 95.0   # hard-hit threshold for labels in training\nROLL_WINDOW     = 10     # smoothing within outings\nMAX_PITCH_IDX   = 110    # last pitch number to chart\nTOP_IMPORTANCE  = 30\nMIN_OUTINGS_CI  = 2\nSHAP_SAMPLES    = 800\nSEED            = 42\n\nNote: You’ll need xgboost, scikit-learn, and (optionally) shap.

While my recent professional work has been public health-centered, including a project at Oregon Health & Science University, where I created an agentic AI pipeline to aid with prostate cancer diagnosis, I’ve recently been drawn back to the field that originally sparked my interest in data science: baseball analytics.\nThis portfolio displays a few baseball-focused projects I’ve worked on recently, combining: - Statistical modeling (run value, pitch models, decision models)\n- Machine learning (XGBoost, clustering, classification)\n- R-based data engineering & visualization\n- Baseball domain knowledge grounded in process over outcomes\nMy goal is to create tools that help coaches, analysts, and players make better decisions\n— from swing decisions and pitch shapes to defensive positioning and player development."

    "section": "",
    "text": "0.1 Intro\n\n\nCode\n# As a former collegiate pitcher and little-league catcher, I've always been enthralled by the idea of pitch calling. Baseball, at its strategic core, is a game of information, deception, and probabilistic decision-making. Every pitch is a trade-off between prediction and surprise — the pitcher’s sequencing and tunneling shaping how a hitter perceives and reacts. This project quantifies and models those hidden layers of decision-making: how pitch type, location, and previous context (including the order of these pitches) interact to influence hitting outcomes such as OBP, SLG, and OPS. By transforming raw Statcast data into structured pitch sequences, the analysis explores whether algorithms can detect the subtle, repeatable signatures of effective pitching strategies. This work is not only a statistical exercise but also a look at the psychology and optimization of in-game tactics. It offers a framework for how data-driven insights might one day complement or even redefine the intuition of pitchers and coaches when calling pitches. Finally, the project assesses the efficacy of tunneling pitches.\n\n\n\n\n0.2 Setup & Data Pull (Statcast)\n\n\nCode\n# This block acquires Statcast pitch-level data and standardizes schema for downstream reuse.\n# Ensures every metric/visual that follows is apples-to-apples across seasons and sources.\n\nimport duckdb, pybaseball as pb, pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import date\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pb.statcast(\"2023-01-01\", \"2025-12-31\")\ndf2 = df.copy()\n\n\n\n\n0.3 Statistical Aggregation\n\n\nCode\n# I aggregated plate-appearance outcomes to compute OBP, SLG, and OPS by sequence.

It asks: Does the outcome of the previous plate appearance increase the odds of a positive outcome on the next PA? My estimate is basically zero (–0.002 ≈ 0), statistically insignificant (p = 0.80), and in the wrong direction (slightly negative). So to conclude, under this model, no evidence of a hot hand exists. These results are exactly in line with the original “hot hand fallacy” literature."

I’m quite wary of these results, though. “Last 5 PA performance” is not a proper hot-hand variable, it is likely confounded with many variables, especially batter & pitcher talent (sure, a hitter who’s 5-for-his-last-5 is more likely to get a hit than a hitter who’s 0-for-his-last-5, but that’s probably because the 5-5 hitter is simply better than the 0-5 hitter, not because he’s hot.) This is the exact reason why most hot-hand literature I’ve read emphasizes within-player randomization, permutation tests, and fixed effects."

The observed lag-1 coefficient from the logistic regression with batter fixed effects was –0.0021, essentially zero. The permutation distribution centered tightly around zero, and 37.5% of the permuted coefficients were greater than the observed value, while 80% were more extreme in absolute value. This indicates that the observed effect falls well within what would be expected by random chance. Overall, the permutation test provides no evidence of a hot-hand effect in MLB hit outcomes."

    "text": "Conclusion:\nAcross all three approaches, there is no evidence of a hot-hand effect in MLB hitting. The logistic regression with batter fixed effects shows that a hitter’s previous plate appearance has essentially zero predictive value for the next one (β = –0.0021, p = 0.80). The permutation test confirms this: the observed coefficient falls squarely inside the null distribution generated by random shuffles, yielding a two-sided p ≈ 0.80. Although the “last-5 PA streakiness” model produces a large positive coefficient, this reflects mechanical autocorrelation introduced by using a rolling average of the outcome variable—not genuine predictive power about future success. Taken together, these results indicate that MLB hitters do not show measurable short-term hot-hand effects once you control for player ability and appropriate statistical dependencies."
